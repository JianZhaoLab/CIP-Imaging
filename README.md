# CIP-Imaging
Repository for Computational Infrared Photothermal Imaging project: code and data sharing (in preparation)
# Computational Infrared Photothermal Imaging (CIP-Imaging)

This repository is dedicated to sharing code, metadata, and links to data 
associated with the **Computational Infrared Photothermal Imaging** project 
developed in the Zhao Lab at the University of Oklahoma.

## Code
Analysis pipelines and algorithms will be deposited here as the project develops.

## Data
Experimental datasets will be shared via **Zenodo** with DOI assignment.  
Links to the datasets will be provided in this repository upon release.

## Citation
Each GitHub release will be archived and assigned a DOI through Zenodo integration, 
ensuring permanent accessibility and long-term availability.

## Planned Timeline
- **Year 1**: Initial code release for computational framework.  
- **Upon first publication**: Upload of representative datasets to Zenodo with DOI.  
- **Subsequent years**: Incremental releases of updated algorithms, analysis scripts, 
  and additional datasets.

_This repository currently serves as a **placeholder** for the planned project 
resources (proposal stage)._
